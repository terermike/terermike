## About Me

Hello there! I'm **Michael Kiplangat**, a passionate *full-stack developer* with a strong bias towards *backend technologies*. My journey in the world of programming began with a curiosity about how the digital world operates, and that curiosity has now evolved into a deep expertise in building robust and scalable web applications.

### Backend Expertise

My backend specialization revolves around creating efficient and secure server-side architectures. I'm well-versed in **Node.js** and have a knack for crafting **RESTful APIs** that serve as the backbone of modern applications. Whether it's handling data, managing user authentication, or optimizing server performance, I thrive on turning complex challenges into elegant solutions.

### Tech Stack

In the backend realm, I have a solid grasp of **Python** and **Javascript** and their application in various scenarios, whether it's scripting, data processing, or backend logic. My proficiency extends to both **SQL** and **NoSQL** databases, allowing me to choose the right data storage solution for different project requirements.

### MERN Enthusiast

While I specialize in backend development, I'm no stranger to the frontend. I've worked extensively with the **MERN** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack to build immersive and responsive user interfaces. With a keen eye for design, I craft engaging frontend experiences using **HTML** and **CSS** that seamlessly integrate with the backend.

### Containerization and Version Control

I'm a firm believer in the power of DevOps practices. I'm well-acquainted with **Docker**, which enables me to create consistent and isolated environments for seamless deployment. My proficiency in **Git** ensures that version control is at the heart of every project, allowing for collaboration and efficient code management.

### Constant Learner

Technology never stands still, and neither do I. I'm always excited to explore new tools and techniques to enhance my skill set. Whether it's delving into microservices architecture, learning about emerging frontend frameworks, or diving into cloud services, I'm committed to staying on the cutting edge.

### Passion and Dedication

What sets me apart is my unwavering passion for creating meaningful digital experiences. I take immense pride in writing clean, maintainable code that not only works but is a joy to work with. I thrive in collaborative environments, valuing open communication and the opportunity to learn from others.
